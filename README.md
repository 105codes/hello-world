# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm just getting on board GitHub. I'm excited and hope to enjoy every bit of GitHub and coding.

My name is Ifeanyi Okogwu. I studied engineering at University of Nigeria, Nsukka in Enugu State of Nigeria. I'm married and I have children. I love coding and want to make something out of it.
